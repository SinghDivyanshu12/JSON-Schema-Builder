# JSON Schema Builder: Procedure
A modern, recursive JSON Schema Builder built with React, TypeScript, Ant Design (AntD), and React Hook Form.

This application allows users to dynamically construct a JSON schema with nested fields, edit keys/types, 
and preview the generated JSON structure in real time â€” all via a clean, responsive UI.
